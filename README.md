**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

```
usage: lane_line_detection.py [-h] [--image [PATH]] [--video [PATH]]
                              [--startTime [INT]] [--endTime [INT]]
                              [--visLog INT] [--format STRING] [--outDir PATH]
                              [--calDir PATH]

a tool for detecting lane lines in images and videos

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --image [PATH]     image from a front facing camera. to detect lane lines
  --video [PATH]     video from a front facing camera. to detect lane lines
  --startTime [INT]  while developing the image pipeline it can be helpful to
                     focus on the difficult parts of an video, so to start at
                     processing at a certain time. e.g. 25 for 25 seconds
                     after begin.
  --endTime [INT]    to end processing video at a certain time, use this
                     argument. e.g. 30 for end processing 30 seconds after
                     video begin.
  --visLog INT       for debugging or documentation of the pipeline.

```
### 4. Camera Calibration

The code for this step is contained in the 'calibrateCamera' function in the lines 852 through 923 of the file 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py'.  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to a calibration image itself using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: 

![alt text][image2]![alt text][image3]

After a successful calibration procedure, the return value, camera calibration matrix, distortion coefficients, the rotation and the translation vectors (ret, mtx, dist, rvecs, tvecs) are written to a pickle file '.calibration.pkl' and placed in the directory, where the calibration images reside. The next time the program is called with the same calibration images, there won't be the need to go through the calibration effort again. Instead the precalculated calibration parameters will be read from the pickle file.

### 5. Pipeline (single images)

The image pipeline is shaped by 12 image processing steps. The high level code for the image pipeline is contained in the 'laneLinePipeline' function in the lines 64 through 255 of the file 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py'.
The pipeline transforms an input image to an image with the found lane in it.

![Input][image4]![Output][image5]

#### Step 1. Distortion Correction

This step uses the the `cv2.undistort` function with the camera calibration matrix and the distortion coefficients to undistort the image (line 92 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py').
![Input][image4]    ![Undistort][image6]

#### Step 2. Grayscale Image

The Image is converted to grayscale. This version is needed for some subsequent processing steps (line 102 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py').
![Undistort][image6]    ![Grayscale][image7]

#### Step 3. Binary Mask Of Sobel Operator

The Magnitude Sobel-xy-Operator is performed on the grayscale image. This results in a binary mask image (line 113 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py')
![Grayscale][image7]    ![Binary Sobel xy][image8]

#### Step 4. Binary Mask Of Saturation

The undistorted RGB image is converted to the HLS colorspace. From the HLS colorspace, the thresholded S-Channel results in a binary mask image (line 124 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py').

![Binary Sobel][image8]    ![Binary Saturation][image9]

#### Step 5. Combinated Binary Mask Of Sobel And Saturation

The binary masks from step 3 and step 4 are combinated in line 135 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py'.

![Binary Combination][image10]

#### Step 6. Perspectively Skewed Rectangle

A perspectively skewed rectangle is placed on the image in line 146 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py'.

![Binary Combination][image10]    ![Skewed Rectangle][image11]

#### Step 7/8. Birds Eye View

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `transformToBirdsView()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).
I hardcoded the source and destination points in the following manner:

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 200, 720      | 250, 720      | 
| 1080, 720     | 1030, 720     |
| 685, 450      | 1030, 0       |
| 595, 450      | 250, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image. (line 146 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py').

![Skewed Rectangle][image11]    ![Birds Eye View][image12]

#### Step 9. Histogram

The Pixels in the lower half of the warped combined binary image are counted with a histogram. The lines are at these x positions where the most white (binary!) pixels are found (line 173 through 179 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py').

![Birds Eye View][image12]    ![Histogram][image13]

#### Step 10. Detecting Lane Lines

From step 9 we know the x-positions of the lines in the lower half of the image. From there we detect the upper area of the lines with a sliding window approach. In each y-bin the bright pixels are counted and the mean x-position is where the line is situated in the current window. Then we fit the lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial (line 193 through 198 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py').

![Sliding Window][image14]

#### Step 11. Overlay Detected Lines

The found lines and the lane is being drawn onto the undistorted rgb image (line 228 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py'). 

![Colored Lane][image15]

#### Step 12. Overlay Text - Result

The curvature of the detected lane and the vehicle-deviation from the lane center is being calculated and written onto the image (line 244 of 'lib/helper_lane_lines.py'). 

![Output][image16]

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
